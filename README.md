# pattern-separation
 A custom Visbrain environment for sorting neuronal spike trains 

In the human brain, the hippocampus is theorized to transform non-simultaneous input patterns into less similar output patterns in a process known as "pattern separation", allowing us to distinguish similar memories from one another.

**pattern-separation** sorts neuronal spike trains across all combinations of user-specified properties (e.g. left/right, anterior/posterior, CA1/CA3, etc). Additionally, Arduino ultrasonic and IR sensors were used to enable control of the system without access to the keyboardâ€”-as well as allow user gestures to increase/decrease the amount of "pattern separation" within the custom Visbrain environment.

## INSTALLATION
### Code
1. Clone or download the [pattern-separation](https://github.com/garrettmflynn/pattern-separation) repository

2. Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/).

3. Create a conda environment from the environment.yml file.

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## USAGE
Default Settings upon Installation:
* Synthetic Data
* Keyboard Control

### Run with **Default Settings**
Enter the pattern-separation directory, then run pattern-separation.py.
```bash
$ python pattern-separation.py
```
### Load **Custom Data**
Example scripts for loading your own binary signals are included in the /custom folder.

Enter the pattern-separation directory, then run pattern-separation.py.
```bash
$ python pattern-separation.py
```

### Enable **Remote + Gesture Control**

#### Wire Up Your Arduino

#### Update the Control Method
On line 80, replace 
```python
id.episode(shader='separation', control_method='keyboard')
```
with
```python
id.episode(shader='separation', control_method='Remote_Gesture)
```
